# \*kali

\*kali is a calendar application for berlin-based groups of women* who learn how to code.
\*kali is a platform that gathers all events of those groups, in order to build a stronger community and increase their visibility. 

Every group can create an account and post their events so that everyone interested can browse through them.

\*kali is an open source project that was started in 2019 by the [code curious](https://www.codecurious.org) study group "Ruby Stars". If you want to contribute to our project, go for it and check out our guidelines: [contributors.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)
