[Community Calendar for code curious and friends]


EPIC </br>
A calender where multiple organizations (code curious, heart of code, pyladies,...) can CRUD - create, read, update and delete events and that can be accessed by users who are interested in these events.


ADMIN STORIES </br>
As an organization such as code curious I want to be able to...

- add an event with the following characteristics: date, time, location, title, description, type of event, max. number of participants, public or private, programming language/tags.

- edit and delete the event.

- see the events in different calendar views: weekly, monthly.

I also want only registered users to be able to manage events.


USER STORIES </br>
As a calendar user I want to be able to...

- see all the events in different calendar views (weekly and monthly).

- distinguish between the different organizations by different colours.

- filter the events by: organization, type of event, time range, programming language.

- search for events by tags , i.e. "beginners"

- find short information about the organizations and links to their websites.


DEVELOPER STORY </br>
As developers we want to..

- use the rails calendar helper instead of whole APIs to be able to learn more.

- add the organizors as admin manually instead of setting up a whole log-in-system.


NEXT STEPS </br>

- think about the database structure and make a drawing.
- ...?
