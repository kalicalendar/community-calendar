# * kali

EPIC </br>
* kali is a calendar application for berlin-based women*-who-code groups (code curious, heart of code, pyladies,...).
Through * kali all events of all groups can be seen in one calender view (in order to...build a stronger/bigger community??). Every group can create, read, update and delete events that can be accessed (website?) by users who are interested in these events.

* kali is an open source project that was started by a rubystars (code curious) study group in 2019. If you want to contribute, go HERE.

## ADMIN|ORGANIZATION STORIES </br>
As an organization such as "Code Curious" I want to be able to...

1) see a calendar.

2) create events with the following characteristics: 
   First priority: date, time, title, description.
   Second priority: location, tags, "hosted by".   
   Third priority: type of event, max. number of participants, public or private event.

3) edit created events.

4) delete events.

5) see events in different calendar views: 
    First priority: monthly.
    Second priority: weekly, year. 
    
6) create a profile for the organization with the following characteristics: 
    First priority: name of the organization, short description, link to the website, a picture.
    Second priority: list of events added by the organization.

7) edit the profile of the organization. 

8) delete the profile of the organization.
  
9) I also want that only registered organizations have the power to add, edit and delete events from the calendar.


## USER STORIES </br>
As a calendar user I want to be able to...

1) see all the events titles in the calendar: 
    First priority: monthly.
    Second priority: weekly, year.
    
2) click on the events and see the information.

3) distinguish between the different organizations by different colours.

4) filter the events by: 
    First priority: organization.
    Second priority: type of event. 

5) search for events by tags , i.e. "beginners" or programming language.

6) find short information about the organizations and links to their websites.


## DEVELOPER STORIES </br>
As developers we want to..

- use the rails calendar helper instead of whole APIs to be able to learn more.

- add the organizations as admin manually instead of setting up a whole log-in-system.
